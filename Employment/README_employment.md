**Instructions on how to gather the data for the Job Openings over Unemployment plot**

**For job openings data**
- Visit https://www.bls.gov/jlt/data.htm
- Select “One Screen”
- To get job openings, select “total nonfarm,” then the area in which you want the data, either US, South, or South Carolina. Then Select “all areas,” “job openings,” “all class sizes,” click on “level-in thousands,” and finally “seasonally adjusted” to get the number of job openings in the region
- Click “add to selection” and then “get data”
- A table of data should appear, double check that you have the level of job openings and not the rate
- To change the data into an easier format to work with, select “More formatting options”
- Change table format to column format. Specify year range from 2000-present. Select retrieve data
- You should see the same data, now in column format with a download option above it. Click on the file and save it to the data folder on your computer. Repeat this process for the remaining regions needed in the graph, and push all changes to github when completed.

**For unemployment data**
- The national unemployment rate can be retrieved from FRED. However, FRED only has quarterly data for South Carolina and South unemployment, we will need to go to another source.

- For South data, select "Census Regions and Divisions" (at the bottom of the state list), "M Census regions," "South Region," and "seasonally adjusted"
- Click "add to selection" and "get data"
- Click on “More formatting options” and change table format to column format and specify the year range as 2000-present. 
- Once you retrieve the data, you should see multiple tables in column format. Make sure you download the excel file that says "Measure: unemployment" not the file that says "Measure: unemployment rate"
- Go back to the Local Area Unemployment Statistics one screen. 
- Select "South Carolina," "Statewide," and "seasonally adjusted"
- Click "add to selection" and "get data"
- Click on “More formatting options” and change table format to column format and specify the year range as 2000-present.
